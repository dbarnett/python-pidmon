pidmon
======
pidmon is a collection of hacks to monitor running processes for activities,
detecting when processes are created and destroyed and helping to wait for
activity on a certain PID.

Inspired by discussion on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6102535/

Examples
========
Exploring the process tree:

    >>> p = pidmon.Process(1)
    >>> p.name
    'init'
    >>> p.children
    [...]

Waiting on processes:

    >>> pidmon.waitpid(5) # doesn't need to be be a child process
    >>> pidmon.waitpid(10001, recursive=True) # wait for process and any orphaned descendants

You can also catch processes that are started indirectly, e.g. through a
factory:

    >>> pidmon.waitpid(12345, graft_func=lambda p: p.name == 'gnome-terminal')
